      <h5 class="card-title">LATTE: A 3D LiDAR Annotation Tool</h5>
      <p class="card-text">
        This was a year-long project while I was an undergraduate researcher at Adept Lab, under the supervision of Bichen Wu and Kurt Keutzer. 
        I designed a human-in-the-loop pipeline for labelling 3D LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data for training autonomous driving systems. 
        As far as I know, this is the first of its kind to be open-sourced on Github. 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        The 3D graphics are rendered using Three.js, with Flask as the back-end for exposing an API that leverages machine learning algorithms to automate the data labelling process. 
        By integrating sensor fusion, one-click annotation, and object tracking, I was able prove through experiments that our method is efficient than manual labelling. 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        With LATTE, we are able to accelerate LiDAR point cloud annotation by 6.2x and significantly improve label quality with 23.6% and 2.2% higher instance-level precision and recall, and 2.0% higher bounding box IoU. 
        These results led to a paper submission that was accepted to IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation 2019.

      <h5 class="card-title">Seam Carving</h5>
      <p class="card-text"> 
        In this project, we implement seam carving, a content-aware image resizing technique. 
        A seam is a connected path from one side of the image to the other that chooses exactly one pixel from each column (or row).
        We remove seams until we end up with an image of our desired size.
        The resulting image should be a cropped image where we remove "unimportant" details.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        I also implemented object removal using seam carving and seam insertion.
        I first make a mask for the object I want to delete.
        I set the values in the mask such that the masking region for the object is negative and the rest of the mask to be zero.
        Then for seam carving I multiply the mask with the energy map, keeping the rest of the algorithm the same.
        Then I inserted vertical seams to resize the image back to the original size.

      <h5 class="card-title">Fake Miniatures</h5>
      <p class="card-text"> 
        In this project, we create fake miniatures by simulating tilt-shift photography that is normally achieved using selective focus cameras.
        We are effectively narrowing the perceived depth of field in a scene and creates the illusion that it was taken with a lens was really close to the subject. 
        To achieve this effect, we first create a mask around our desired subject.
        We then use the mask to blur the background such that regions that are farther from the subject are increasingly blurred.

        I explored image blending using computing a Gaussian and Laplacian stack for two images and blending each layer of both stacks.
        The final blended image is computed by adding all the layers of the stacks.

        I also explored gradient domain fusion that uses linear least squares regression to solve for the optimal boundary for blending a masked source image into a target image.

      <p class="card-text"> 
        A basic camera can be made with a small hole. 
        The light enters the pinhole, then projects onto a screen. 
        Light that reflects off an object enters the hole and collects on the screen.
        If we take a long exposure of all light that hits this screen, it is possible to see the object that light is reflecting off of.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        We made a DIY pinhole camera using a shoebox. We covered the inside with black paper except for the side opposite to the pinhole.
        We then made sure that the only way that light can enter the box is through the pinhole. 
        Therefore, we duct taped all sides of the box to eliminate any holes. We then cut two holes in the boxâ€“one for the pinhole, and one for the DSLR.

      <p class="card-text"> 
        As early as 1907, Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii was given permission to capture scenes using red, green, and blue filters that can form color images when aligned. 
      This project aims at automatically aligning, cropping, and adjusting the color of three 3 separate grayscale images that are supposed to represent the red, green, and blue color channels.
